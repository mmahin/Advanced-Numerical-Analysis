##  Notes:
	1. All files can be run directly using matlab
	2. We calculate and Plot for all 4*4=16 combinations (Gamma, C)
	3. Matlab Code Files are organized in folders based on Question
	4. It may take a while for the calculations of all 16 combinations
	5. Details and documentations are provided in the Code files

THANKS!!!
